    Phase II: Validating the DAO Health Assessment

    OverviewIn this phase of the DAO Health Assessment Development, we will validate our instrument for content validity. Since criterion validity can be examined through analysis of outcomes relative to measured constructs, analysis of criterion validity will be included in phase 3.What is content validity?The degree to which a measure is representative of all aspects of a construct. Since we aim to measure DAO health, we should ensure that we are effectively measuring all aspects of DAO health. Note that we are focusing on the psychometric side of DAO health in this study. We acknowledge that a complete picture of DAO health includes aspects of communication and on-chain activity.Study design:To assess whether our instrument captures the full content of DAO health, we can leverage the expertise of leaders in the field to crowdsource feedback on whether:our measures make sense in the context of the DAOthe underlying items make sense for the overarching constructthe full scope of constructs is sufficient to constitute DAO healthTo do this, we will need to design a survey that provides an operational definition for each construct and asks respondents the following:Rate the degree to which this construct and its operational definition fit the context of DAO healthIf low rating, ask whyRate the degree to which the underlying items sufficiently measure the construct as outlined in the operational definitionif low rating, ask whyRate the degree to which the range of constructs in this survey constitutes a sufficient measure of DAO health:What measures would you remove?What other measures would you include?Project Objectives:Proposal page on OCEAN:
