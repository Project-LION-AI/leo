    What are Guilds and How Do I Join? 

    What are GuildsGuilds are a pool of skills that can come under a single umbrella. Examples include the Writer's Guild, Research Guild, Developer's Guild, etc.Guilds at Talent DAO only have a handful of requirements:Guilds must have a constitution that defines the vision, goals, key roles, and how governance (decision rights) works within the guild. Vision and goals should be supportive of TalentDAO. Guilds must have three elected roles at a minimum: Guild leader, historian, and treasurer. Guilds should have a reputation system in place for voting, incentives, and recognition. Guilds need to provide a progress report on a seasonal basis in order to maintain good standing with the DAO. Guilds may be marked as inactive if frequent updates are not provided. Inactive Guilds are not eligible for resource support. Outside of these requirements Guilds are very autonomous and can pursue their own interests independently of TalentDAO. They can raise funds, apply for grants, or even pursue product dev, and consulting services. Guilds could be a public good, an internal center of excellence, or education hubs to onboard new members. Hopefully, this helps describe how I'm thinking about Guilds.~  How Do I Join?Head over to Talent DAO Discord → Come to #get-roles Channel → Select respective emoji Congrats, You just Joined a Guild(Opened up Channels)!
