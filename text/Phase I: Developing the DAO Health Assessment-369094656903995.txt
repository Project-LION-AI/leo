    Phase I: Developing the DAO Health Assessment

    This phase has been completed! Write-up on mirror.xyz:OverviewA grant has been submitted to the OCEAN protocol to develop a DAO Contributor Health Assessment. While the ultimate goal of this project is to deliver a validated survey and publish a paper on the work, we have committed to delivering the OceanDAO a write-up of the literature review and a pre-validated survey. Fortunately, this work should tie into the remaining work for the study nicely.View submitted OCEAN proposal: View running hypotheses:Project Outline:Literature reviewEmpirically driven survey design [pre-validated]Survey deployment and data collection [from other DAOs]Statistical Modeling / Item reductionResearch paper write-upCommunity peer-reviewPublication in the Journal of Decentralized WorkHow to get involved:We are currently at the literature phase of this project and would love if this could be a community effort. In order to make this possible, we have outlined the steps in our  that we would like this community to follow when conducting a literature review. Once these steps have been completed, please fill out a new page in the litDB below to add your resource to the collection.Selection criteria for construct/dimensions:Relevant: Must be a known predictor of relevant individual/team/organizational outcomes OR must be an outcome itselfActionable: If measured, DAOs shall be able to act upon itInteresting: Should be a dimension DAOs would like to know how they compare to other DAOsAppropriate: Should be measured at a level of analysis consistent with other dimensions
